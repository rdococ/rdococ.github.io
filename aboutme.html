		<p>
			Rdococ is a member of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> that does things.<br />
			Things I did do, and are doing, in no particular order, include:
			<ul>
				<li>Playing <a href="http://www.minetest.net/">Minetest</a>, and creating mods with its lua API (suck on that, Minecraft!).</li>
				<li>I have <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> - which I mainly use to play Portal 2.</li>
				<li>Chatting on IRC! I even play games of <a href="https://werewolf.chat/">Werewolf</a> there, too.</li>
				<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is the kid's programing language that enabled me to acquaint myself with other languages, such as Lua.</li>
				<li>I used to play <a href="http://roblox.com">Roblox</a>, but then I switched to Linux -- and a Linux port is not in their "top priority".</li>
				<li>I use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (duh) a fair amount nowadays, now that I've begun to acquaint myself with the git command line.</li>
				<li>I used to play <a href="http://powdertoy.co.uk">The Powder Toy</a>, but I don't much nowadays.</li>
			</ul>
