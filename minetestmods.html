		<heading><h1>Minetest Mods</h1></heading>
		<p>
			In my spare time, I have created quite a few mods for Minetest, because it's just so cool.<br />
			Here is a list of the mods I ended up publishing to GitHub.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdococ/effects">effects</a>, which adds a status effect API.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdococ/silicons">silicons</a>, which is a -cons with a floating point state.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdococ/lolchat">lolchat</a>, which adds various cool chat commands, but has been in a bit of a... <em>broken</em> state recently.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdococ/rmod">rmod</a>, including conveyors, grates, and a block-based programming language.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdococ/digimagic">digimagic</a>, enabling luacontrollers to modify the world around them.</li>
			</ul>
